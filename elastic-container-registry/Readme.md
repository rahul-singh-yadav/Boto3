## Batch PUT Lifecycle Policy
---
**ðŸ‘‰ What does this script do?**

Allows you to do the following:

1. Place an ecr lifecycle_policy **rule** to all your repositories based on a specific **tags** placed ecr repo.
2. Put **multiple tags** on ecr repos based on various environments.
3. Reduce your ecr image storage cloudspends.



**ðŸ¤š What does this doesn't do?**
Currently this script doesn't allow to do the following:

1. Place multiple ecr lifecycle_policy based **rules** for now
2. Cannot paginate for now.
3. Code isn't optimized yet, it lacks reusability for now.

**Example Policy**:

```
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "rulePriority": 1,
            "description": "Keep only one untagged image, expire all others.",
            "selection": {
                "tagStatus": "untagged",
                "countType": "imageCountMoreThan",
                "countNumber": 1
            },
            "action": {
                "type": "expire"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
